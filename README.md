# Flutter_Provider_Demo

This file is to demonstrate how Flutter Provider implemented in Shopping App (in simple way). Please feel free to view my Flutter videos on Youtube Channel (link at below).


# Provider (Flutter) [https://pub.dev/packages/provider]

A wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable.
By using provider instead of manually writing InheritedWidget, you get:

1. simplified allocation/disposal of resources
2. lazy-loading
3. a vastly reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time
4. devtool friendly â€“ using Provider, the state of your application will be visible in the Flutter devtool
5. a common way to consume these InheritedWidgets (See Provider.of/Consumer/Selector)
6. increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity (such as ChangeNotifier, which is O(N) for dispatching notifications).

To read more about a provider, see its documentation [https://pub.dev/documentation/provider/latest/provider/provider-library.html].
